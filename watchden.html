            <h1>User Flow</h1>
            <p>
                In this case, the brand was developed before user flows or screen layouts were even approached. Initially this was all about look and feel. Establishing a clear identity was key in making the many decisions to come throughout the development of the application. Although we're dealing with a virtual experience, I wanted to introduce an heir of distinction.
            </p>
                <p>
While researching other online watch stores, I found there were many solid options for selection and function, although few provided the careful curation of exclusively watch content, presented with an added elegance to the familiar online shopping experience.
</p>
<p>
With ease and function as the focus, I moved the process along to user stories. What are the essential steps required for a user to go from “I want”, to “I’m wearing it”. Putting myself in the online shoppers shoes, I walked through the required steps from the welcome screen to a successful checkout.

                <h1>User Stories</h1>
                <p>
                    1) As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.
                </p>
                    <p>
                    2) As a customer, I want to have access to advanced filtering options, so that I don’t have to browse through a lot of products to find what I’m looking for.
                </p>
                    <p>
                    3) As a customer, I want to be able to place multiple items in a shopping cart, so that I can purchase more than one item at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the user flow was established, I made a series of loose but deliberate sketches outlining the size and position of all key elements required on each screen defined in the user flow. This was valuable in flushing out the optimal screen layouts while eliminating less viable ones, without time spent polishing details.

                        <h1>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
                        <p>
                            I then rebuilt the wireframes digitally. This was time to establish the precise spacial and interactive relationship of every element in terms of their purpose and function. Before applying the brand styling to the app, I had several users test out a medium fidelity prototype. I asked each user to perform the tasks described in the user stories. This process was very helpful in revealing areas for improvement.
